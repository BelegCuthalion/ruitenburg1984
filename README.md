This is a fork from [Tadeusz Litak's formalisation](https://git8.cs.fau.de/software/ruitenburg1984/) of W. Ruitenburg JSL 1984 paper "On the Period of Sequences (An(p)) in Intuitionistic Propositional Calculus", for Coq v8.4pl6.

What is being developed in `8.6/` is a port that is intended to
    1. be compatible with Coq v8.6, and
    2. make the least sense of what is going on.
